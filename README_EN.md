# ⚔️ Caravan Hero

### About the Project

**Caravan Hero** is a **turn-based tactical RPG with Roguelite elements**.

The concept revolves around the strategic management of a hero squad. The player must recruit mercenaries of different classes (Warrior, Mage, Tank, etc.), position them on the battlefield, and face infinite waves of procedurally generated enemies. The game features:

* **Turn-Based Combat:** Based on Initiative and Speed stats.
* **Economy:** Earn gold, hire new units from the shop.
* **Progression:** Leveling system, Attributes (Str, Agi, etc.), and "Rebirth" (Tier) mechanics.
* **Permadeath:** If a unit dies, it is lost forever.

### Technologies Used

The project was developed entirely with native Web technologies (Vanilla), without external frameworks, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming and design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Managers).
